## A little about me:

I have a Bachalor's and Master's degree in Physics by Rio de Janeiro State University - UERJ. At this moment, I've been working theoretically with crystalline material undergoing different intensity of magnetic fields to describe its magnetic and thermal properties. Forward, I'm using a model Hamiltonian described by Zeeman interactions taked from Hund's rules, change interactions in the mean field approximation and crystal fields interactions in the point-charge approximation.
